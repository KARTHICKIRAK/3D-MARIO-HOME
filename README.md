# 3D House Project

This is a 3D house visualization created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a detailed 3D room with various furniture elements, lighting effects, and interactive mouse controls.

## Project Structure

### Files:
1. **index.html** - The main HTML file containing the structure of the 3D house
2. **style.css** - Contains all the styling and 3D transformations for the house elements
3. **script.js** - Handles the mouse interaction to rotate the 3D view

## Key Features

- **3D Perspective**: The entire scene is rendered with CSS 3D transformations
- **Interactive Controls**: The house rotates based on mouse movement
- **Detailed Interior**: Includes furniture like:
  - TV with animated screen
  - Bookshelf with books
  - Sofa set
  - Coffee table
  - Wall decorations
  - Speakers
- **Lighting Effects**: Multiple light sources with gradients and glow effects
- **Shadows**: Realistic shadows enhance the 3D effect

## How It Works

1. The HTML defines all the 3D elements as nested divs
2. CSS applies 3D transformations to create the house structure
3. JavaScript listens for mouse movements and adjusts the perspective

## Customization

You can modify:
- Colors in the CSS
- Dimensions of elements
- Lighting effects
- Mouse sensitivity in the JavaScript

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. Move your mouse to rotate the 3D view.

## Project Conversion Notes

I've converted the original project files to standard web formats:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Converted SCSS to CSS**  
   - Original SCSS syntax has been compiled to standard CSS
   - All nested rules expanded
   - Variables replaced with their values
   - Mixins inlined

2. **Fixed HTML Structure**  
   - Corrected malformed HTML tags
   - Ensured proper nesting of elements
   - Fixed missing/duplicate elements
   - Standardized indentation and formatting

3. **Optimized Files**  
   - Combined related styles
   - Removed redundant code
   - Maintained all original functionality

## How to Use

1. **index.html** - The main HTML file with the corrected structure
2. **style.css** - The compiled CSS version (originally SCSS)
3. **script.js** - The interactive JavaScript (unchanged)

Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser to view the 3D house. Move your mouse to rotate the view.

## Original vs Converted

- **Original**: Likely used SCSS preprocessing and had some HTML issues
- **Converted**: Pure CSS with fixed HTML while maintaining identical visual output

All original functionality and styling has been preserved in the conversion process.

This project appears to be inspired by or adapted from Ricardo Oliva Alonso's work on CodePen.
